    <h1 class="text-3xl text-center"><strong>Meet Nicole</strong></h1>

    <p>
        Born and raised in Clearwater, Florida, Nicole Tobiassen’s entrepreneurial spirit was present from an early age, when, in Kindergarten,
        she started selling iron-on T-shirt art from her parents’ driveway. After graduating from the University of South Florida
        with a major in History and a minor in Archaeology, Nicole embarked on a successful career at Enterprise Rent-A-Car,
        overseeing daily operations management and gradually climbing the ranks. She proved to be an exceptional leader
        and was recognized as the number one national account manager worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
        During her time at Enterprise, Nicole excelled in growing the government contract sector and securing professional sports team accounts
        and sponsorships. Her dedication and strategic approach led to remarkable results, notably transforming the US CENTCOM account from five cars to hundreds.
        Through the relationships she formed as the account manager for the Border Patrol and New Mexico National Guard,
        Nicole learned a great deal about the challenges our law enforcement faces at the US-Mexico border.
        She led the Southwest corporate and government sales team from last place in the world rankings to first place in just one year.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2006, Nicole moved to Albuquerque and made the life-altering decision to retire from her corporate career and prioritize
        spending time with her family. However, her entrepreneurial drive and desire to make a positive impact on others’ lives remained strong.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2008, amidst the recession, she and her husband, Mark, founded ActionCOACH, recognizing the opportunity to provide coaching and guidance
        to business owners and leaders during challenging times. Over the past 15 years, they have had the privilege of being part of hundreds
        of individuals’ growth journeys, helping them achieve remarkable results in their businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both Nicole and Mark have been widely recognized for their contributions to the business world, and Nicole was honored with the prestigious
        40 Under 40 award by Biz Journal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nicole’s life changed forever when Mark was faced with a sudden life-or-death health crisis in 2017,
        which resulted in him having to be transferred to a specialized clinic out-of-state. Overnight she had to become an advocate for his
        care and had to learn everything there was to know about his condition. This experience has driven her to advocate for better
        healthcare for all New Mexicans. New Mexicans should not face a death sentence because they lack the resources to go out-of-state
        for medical care.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Nicole is involved in Rotary International Foundation, Make a Wish Foundation, Lobo Club, 505 Sports Venture New Mexico,
        the Hispano Chamber of Commerce, the Metro Federation of Republican Women, and New Mexico Angels.
        She and Mark are proud parents to Luke (21) and Owen (19).
    </p>
